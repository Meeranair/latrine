## Making a Pull Request

Pull requests are always weclome! To make the process easier on everyone, here are a few guidelines:

1. **Try to make keep commits small**
This helps everyone. It helps you divide up and organize your work and in the unfortunate event that your changes need to be reverted, it is helpful to have work divided into bite-size chunks so that only the parts that need to be reverted get reverted.
1. **Commit messages are important**
A good commit message is like...a good commit message! Easy to read and concise yet informative. If you're looking for guidelines, [this page](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) has some pretty good ones. If you don't feel like reading that, here are a few questions to get you started.

1. What is the current behavior?
2. Why does it need to be changed?
3. How did you change it?

In your message, please include a short, descriptive title and include answers to the above questions in the body.

## Documentation
