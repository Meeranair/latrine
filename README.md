### How to run a cloned Django project:
1. Fork and clone this project.
2. Django requires Python to run. Download the latest source release of Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/ or with your operating system's package manager.
3. Install ```virtualenv``` with ```pip``` (pip is already installed if you're using the latest version of Python). ```virtualenv``` is a tool to create isolated Python environments.
    ```sh
    $ [sudo] pip install virtualenv
    ```
4. Create and activate your virtual environment.
    ```sh
    $ virtualenv env --no-site-packages
    $ source env/bin/activate
    ```
5. After youâ€™ve created and activated a virtual environment, install Django. The recommended way to install Django is with ```pip```:
    ```sh
    $ [sudo] pip install Django
    ```
6. To start the development server, navigate to the Django project directory ```latrine_django``` and from there run:
    ```sh
    $ python manage.py runserver
    ```
7. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser to view the app.
